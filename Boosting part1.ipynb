    "Improved Accuracy: \n",
    "    Increasing the number of estimators allows the AdaBoost algorithm to combine a larger number of weak learners, which can lead to improved predictive accuracy and a reduction in the overall error rate. With more estimators, the model can better capture complex patterns and make more accurate predictions on the training data.\n",
